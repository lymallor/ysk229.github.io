## [PHP Master Series Volume 1](http://blog.calevans.com/2012/11/19/php-master-series-vol-1/)


This is a [virtual conference](http://blog.calevans.com/2012/11/19/php-master-series-vol-1/) that's being organized by Cal Evans. The basic premise is that Cal picked out 6 talks that he felt stood out for the year, and then organized a live virtual conference around those 6 talks. I'll be giving my Cryptography For The Average Developer talk there.

When: December 21st, 2012
Where: Online
Topic(s): Cryptography For The Average Developer
Tickets: [http://phpmasterseriesv1.eventbrite.com/](http://phpmasterseriesv1.eventbrite.com/)## 

## [PHP Benelux](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2013/)


This long-running conference is an anual tradition in central Europe. This year, I'll be giving a brand new talk there entitled "Password Storage (and Hacking) in PHP". Basically, I'll be taking a deep dive into the underlying principals around password storage, and going over (and demonstrating) the actual techniques that attackers would use to breach passwords.


When: January 25th and 26th, 2013

Where: Antwerp, Belgium

Topic(s): Password Storage (and Hacking) in PHP

Another first time conference is shaping up to be a good one. It has lined up some really incredible speakers from around the country, and should be an awesome time. I'll be doing my Cryptography talk as well as my Don't Be STUPID, GRASP SOLID talk (another tweaked version of it).
