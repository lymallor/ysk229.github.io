## [NorthEast PHP](http://www.northeastphp.org/)

I was so impressed by this conference last year that it spawned a blog post [The Anatomy Of A Great Conference](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/08/the-anatomy-of-great-conference.html). This time around, I'll be speaking there! I'm definitely looking forward to it!

## [PHP North West](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw13/)

I attended this conference last year, and was completely blown away by it. It's done so well, and has such a great mix of people, that when they opened their call for papers I just had to do it...
