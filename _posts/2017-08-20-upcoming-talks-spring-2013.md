It's been a little while since I've posted anything here or on YouTube. I've been working on some interesting ideas that hopefully will be pretty decent, so it wasn't time wasted. But I figured now would be a good time to tell you about some upcoming speaking engagements that I have, and where I'll be over the next few months. So with no further adue:
