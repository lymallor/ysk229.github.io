Well, I know it's been a while since my last post here. I've been keeping busy (but also working on some cool stuff for you all, when the time is right). I figured that it was worth while pointing out a few upcoming talks that I'm going to be giving and conferences that I'll be attending.

## PHP North West

I'll be a regular attendee at the [PHP North West 2012](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/phpnw12/) conference in Manchester, UK on October 5th through the 7th. While I'm doing any scheduled talks, I've got a few lightning talks prepared for the unconference track. I'll also be participating in the Hackathon on Friday night leading a PHP Core project hack. So come find me and say hi!

## True North PHP

I will also be speaking at the new [True North PHP](http://truenorthphp.ca/) conference in Toronto, Canada on November 2nd and 3rd! I'll be giving two talks, one on Object Oriented Design. It's similar in concept to the [Don't Be Stupid, Grasp Solid](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/05/dont-be-stupid-grasp-solid-slides.html) talk I gave at NYPHP, but drastically reworked. I'll also be giving a brand new talk entitled "Cryptography for the Average Developer". It's aimed at introducing the concepts of modern cryptography, and arming the average professional developer with enough knowledge to be safe (a daunting task for a 45 minute talk).

Tickets are still available for the True North PHP conference, and it's shaping up to be an awesome one! I'd highly suggest that you try to make it if possible!

I hope to see you there! If you do come to either conference, be sure to find me and say hi!
